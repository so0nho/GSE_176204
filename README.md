## Paper summary
Microglia have a crucial role in the central nervous system aging and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and glaucoma. Normal microglia function help maintain the brain's activity like clearing synapses and 
The uncontrolled activation of microglia can damage and kill neurons. Receptors on myeloid cells 2, such as *Trem2* and *Cx3cr1*
