# Paper summary
The brain and retina undergo inflammation after injury and aging, but the molecular and cellular processes to resolve the inflammation are not well understood. Microglia have a crucial role in the central nervous system aging and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and glaucoma. Normal microglia functions help maintain the brain's activity such as clearing synapses and pathogen surveillance, however, the uncontrolled activation of microglia can damage and kill neurons. 

Since the process to terminate microglia events remain unclear, single-cell RNA sequencing can be used to identify the signals that modulate microglia termination.
