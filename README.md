# Introduction summary
The brain and retina undergo inflammation after injury and aging, but the molecular and cellular processes to resolve the inflammation are not well understood. Microglia have a crucial role in the central nervous system aging and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and glaucoma. Normal microglia functions help maintain the brain's activity such as clearing synapses and pathogen surveillance, however, the uncontrolled activation of microglia can damage and kill neurons. 

In this repository, I will perform single-cell RNA sequencing on microglia isolated from retinas of mice. Using scRNA-seq we can perform differential gene expression 




Since the process to terminate microglia events remain unclear, the authors used a systems genetics approach to identify the predominant involvement of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein like 1 (IGFBPL1) in neurodegeneration and neuroinflammatory modulation.
